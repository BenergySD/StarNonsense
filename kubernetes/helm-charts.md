# Helm Charts

Support for k8s is provided as Helm charts, which makes it easy to deploy and test in k8s. Helm charts describe the services and applications to run in k8s and how they should be deployed, providing a single means for repeatable application deployment.

As of Stardog 7.3.0, the Helm charts are open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stardog-union/helm-charts).
